# RAINFALL

This is a post-common core of the school 42 curriculum, in the cyber security branch, and it comes after SNOW-CRASH. This dives a little deeper in the world of cyber security breaches.
Just like in SNOW-CRASH, we're provided an iso to launch a virtual machine and exploit breaches in a set of levels, where each level corresponds to a user in the machine, amd each flag found is the password to the next user/level.
This time, the project gets deeper into binary exploitation, and introduces us to breaches like ret2libc, format string attack, or shellcode.
