Upon first logging in to the RainFall VM and its first level (level0), we find in the home directory a binary called level0.
When executing it, it causes a segmentation fault, but if we give it arguments, it simply displays "No !".
We reverse engineer it using Ghidra and obtain the source code in C, thus finding out it only contains a main function. The function takes the first argument given in the command line, and checks whether it is 423. If it is, it sends a prompt waiting for a command, with the file creator's privileges (which is level1). Otherwise, it displays "No !".
We now know enough to exploit this breach: we get the prompt and send it:
cat /home/user/level1/.pass
And this is how we get the first pass for level1.
